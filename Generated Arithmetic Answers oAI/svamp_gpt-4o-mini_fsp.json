        "original_answer": "266",
        "answer_text": "Nell originally had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. In total, she had 309 + 356 = 665 cards. After giving some to Jeff, she has 415 cards left. So, she gave away 665 - 415 = 250 cards. \n\nNow, she has 415 cards left, which includes both baseball and Ace cards. To find out how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has, we need to determine how many of each type she has left. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of baseball cards left as \\( b \\) and Ace cards as \\( a \\). We know that \\( b + a = 415 \\). \n\nSince she originally had 309 baseball cards and gave away some, we can express the number of baseball cards left as \\( b = 309 - x \\), where \\( x \\) is the number of baseball cards given away. \n\nSimilarly, for Ace cards, \\( a = 356 - y \\), where \\( y \\) is the number of Ace cards given away. \n\nWe also know that \\( b + a = 415 \\). \n\nTo find how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she has, we can express it as \\( b - a \\). \n\nSubstituting \\( b \\) and \\( a \\) gives us:\n\n\\[\n(309 - x) - (356 - y) = b - a\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n309 - x - 356 + y = b - a\n\\]\n\n\\[\ny - x - 47 = b - a\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need more information about how many cards of each type she gave away to find the exact difference. \n\nBut we can also find the difference in the original counts: \n\nOriginally, she had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. The difference was \\( 309 - 356 = -47 \\). \n\nSince she has 415 cards left, we can assume she has fewer Ace cards now. \n\nTo find the difference in the current counts, we can assume she has \\( b \\) baseball cards and \\( a \\) Ace cards such that \\( b + a = 415 \\). \n\nIf we assume she gave away more Ace cards than baseball cards, we can conclude that she has more baseball cards than Ace cards now. \n\nThus, the difference \\( b - a \\) will be positive. \n\nWithout specific numbers of cards given away, we cannot determine the exact count, but we can conclude that she has more baseball cards than Ace cards. \n\nThe answer is that Nell has more baseball cards than Ace cards, but the exact number cannot be determined without additional information."
