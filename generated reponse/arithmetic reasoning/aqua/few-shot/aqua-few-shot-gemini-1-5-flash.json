        "original_answer": "E",
        "answer_text": "A: Let Friend Q's rate be r km/hr. Then Friend P's rate is 1.15r km/hr. Let t be the time in hours when they pass each other.  The distance Friend Q walks is rt km, and the distance Friend P walks is 1.15rt km.  Since they meet on a 43-km trail, the sum of the distances they walk is 43 km: rt + 1.15rt = 43.  This simplifies to 2.15rt = 43.  Solving for rt, we get rt = 43 / 2.15 ≈ 20.  Therefore, Friend Q walks approximately 20 km.  Friend P walks 43 - 20 = 23 km. The closest answer is (E).\n"

Solving for x, we get x = 5.\n\nThe point (5, y) is on the line, so we substitute x = 5 into the equation: y = (1/5)(5) = 1.\n\nTherefore, x = 5 and y = 1. The answer is (C).\n"

This means there are k members in total.  So we have:\n\nC(k,2) - C(k-2,2) - (k-2) - (k-2) = 6  (Subtracting the combinations with Jim or Ellen)\n\nk(k-1)/2 - (k-2)(k-3)/2 = 6\nk(k-1) - (k-2)(k-3) = 12\nk² - k - (k² - 5k + 6) = 12\n4k - 6 = 12\n4k = 18\nk = 18/4 = 4.5 which is not an integer.  There's a flaw in this approach.\n\nLet's reconsider the problem.  There are k members.  We choose 2.  The number of ways to choose 2 members such that neither Jim nor Ellen are chosen is 6.
