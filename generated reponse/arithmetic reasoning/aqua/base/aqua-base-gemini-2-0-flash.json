        "original_answer": "D",
        "answer_text": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n*   **Understanding the Given Information:** We know that k/l < 1, and k and l are positive integers. This means that k is smaller than l (k < l).\n\n*   **Analyzing the Answer Choices:**\n\n    *   **A) k/l^2:** Since l is a positive integer, l^2 will be even larger than l. Therefore, k/l^2 will be even smaller than k/l, and thus less than 1.\n\n    *   **B) k^2/l:** Let's consider an example. If k = 1 and l = 2, then k^2/l = 1/2, which is less than 1. However, if k = 2 and l = 3, then k^2/l = 4/3, which is greater than 1. So, this is not always greater than 1.\n\n    *   **C) k^2/l^2:** This is the same as (k/l)^2. Since k/l is less than 1, squaring it will result in an even smaller number, which will still be less than 1.\n\n    *   **D) l/k:** Since k < l, then l/k must be greater than 1. For example, if k = 2 and l = 3, then l/k = 3/2, which is greater than 1.\n\n    *   **E) √(k/l):** Since k/l is less than 1, the square root of k/l will also be less than 1.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n\n    The only answer choice that must be greater than 1 is **D) l/k**."

        "question": "Question:\nMike took 5 mock tests before appearing for the GMAT. In each mock test he scored 10 points more than the previous mock test. If he scored 760 on the GMAT and his average score for the mocks and the GMAT was 716.67, what was the difference in the score of his last mock and his GMAT score?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA)20 B)32 C)40 D)50 E)60",
        "original_answer": "B",
        "answer_text": "Here's how to solve the problem:\n\n**1. Calculate the total score of all tests:**\n\n*   Mike took 5 mock tests + 1 GMAT = 6 tests\n*   Average score * number of tests = total score\n*   716.67 * 6 = 4300\n\n**2. Calculate the total score of the mock tests:**\n\n*   Total score of all tests - GMAT score = total mock test score\n*   4300 - 760 = 3540\n\n**3. Set up an equation to find the score of the first mock test:**\n\n*   Let 'x' be the score of the first mock test.\n*   The scores of the mock tests are: x, x+10, x+20, x+30, x+40\n*   The sum of these scores is 5x + 100 = 3540\n\n**4. Solve for x:**\n\n*   5x = 3440\n*   x = 688\n\n**5. Calculate the score of the last mock test:**\n\n*   Last mock test score = x + 40\n*   Last mock test score = 688 + 40 = 728\n\n**6. Find the difference between the last mock test and the GMAT score:**\n\n*   Difference = GMAT score - Last mock test score\n*   Difference = 760 - 728 = 32\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe difference in the score of his last mock and his GMAT score is 32. So the answer is (B)."
