Find the number of combinations without Jim and Ellen:**\n\n* If Jim and Ellen are excluded, we are choosing 2 members from the remaining (k-2) members.  This is given by (k-2)C2 = (k-2)! / (2! * (k-4)!)\n\n**3. Set up an equation:**\n\n* We know that there are 6 combinations where Jim and Ellen are *not* selected.  Therefore:\n   (k-2)C2 = 6\n\n**4. Solve for k:**\n\n* (k-2)! / (2! * (k-4)!) = 6\n* (k-2)(k-3) / 2 = 6  (We can simplify the combination formula)\n* (k-2)(k-3) = 12\n* k² - 5k + 6 = 12\n* k² - 5k - 6 = 0\n* (k-6)(k+1) = 0\n\nThis gives two possible solutions for k: k = 6 or k = -1.  Since we can't have a negative number of band members, the answer is k = 6.\n\nHowever, the problem states there are k-2 members *including* Jim and Ellen.  Therefore, the total number of members is k.  Let's re-examine the equation:\n\nThe total number of combinations is kC2 = k(k-1)/2.\nThe number of combinations without Jim and Ellen is (k-2)C2 = (k-2)(k-3)/2.\nThe number of combinations with Jim and Ellen is kC2 - (k-2)C2 = 6.\n\nSubstituting:\nk(k-1)/2 - (k-2)(k-3)/2 = 6\nk(k-1) - (k-2)(k-3) = 12\nk² - k - (k² - 5k + 6) = 12\n4k - 6 = 12\n4k = 18\nk = 4.5\n\nThis is not a whole number, which is unexpected. There must be a mistake in the problem statement or our interpretation. Let's go back to the original approach:\n\n(k-2)C2 = 6\n(k-2)(k-3)/2 = 6\n(k-2)(k-3) = 12\nk² - 5k + 6 = 12\nk² - 5k - 6 = 0\n(k-6)(k+1) = 0\nk = 6  or k = -1\n\nIf k=6, then there are 4 members in the band excluding Jim and Ellen.  4C2 = 6. This works.  Therefore, the total number of band members is k = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\n**Therefore, the answer is A) 8**\n"

        "original_answer": "B",
        "answer_text": "Here's how to solve this problem step-by-step:\n\n**1. Find the total score of the mock tests and GMAT:**\n\n* The average score for the 5 mock tests and the GMAT (6 tests total) is 716.67.\n* Total score = Average score * Number of tests = 716.67 * 6 = 4300.02 (We'll round this to 4300 for simplicity, as the scores are likely whole numbers).\n\n**2. Find the total score of the mock tests:**\n\n* Total score of mock tests and GMAT = 4300\n* GMAT score = 760\n* Total score of mock tests = 4300 - 760 = 3540\n\n**3. Set up an equation to represent the mock test scores:**\n\nLet x be the score of the first mock test.  The scores of the subsequent tests are x + 10, x + 20, x + 30, and x + 40.\n\nThe sum of these scores is:  x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) + (x + 30) + (x + 40) = 3540\n\n**4. Solve for x:**\n\n5x + 100 = 3540\n5x = 3440\nx = 688 (Score of the first mock test)\n\n**5. Find the score of the last mock test:**\n\nThe last mock test score is x + 40 = 688 + 40 = 728\n\n**6. Find the difference between the last mock test and the GMAT score:**\n\nDifference = GMAT score - Last mock test score = 760 - 728 = 32\n\nTherefore, the difference in the score of his last mock and his GMAT score is 32.\n\n**The answer is B) 32**\n"

        "original_answer": "A",
        "answer_text": "Here's how to solve this problem:\n\n**1. Find the sum of the original numbers:**\n\n* The average of 15 numbers is 40.\n* The sum of the numbers is 15 * 40 = 600\n\n**2. Add 10 to each number:**\n\n* Adding 10 to each of the 15 numbers increases the sum by 15 * 10 = 150.\n* The new sum is 600 + 150 = 750\n\n**3. Find the new average:**\n\n* The new average is the new sum divided by the number of numbers (which remains 15).\n* New average = 750 / 15 = 50\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A) 50**\n"

        "original_answer": "E",
        "answer_text": "Here's how to solve this:\n\n* **Formula:** Distance = Speed × Time\n\n* **Given:**\n    * Speed = 20 km/hr\n    * Time = 2.5 hr\n\n* **Calculation:** Distance = 20 km/hr × 2.5 hr = 50 km\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **E) 50 km**\n"
