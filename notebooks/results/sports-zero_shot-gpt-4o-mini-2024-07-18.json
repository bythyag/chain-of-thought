        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Jamal Murray was perfect from the line\" is plausible if it refers to a basketball game where Jamal Murray made all of his free throw attempts. In basketball, being \"perfect from the line\" means that a player has successfully made every free throw they took during a game. If there is a specific game or context where this occurred, then the statement is accurate. \n\nThe answer is plausible. \n\nThe answer is plausible."

        "question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Jonas Valanciunas beat the buzzer\"",
        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Jonas Valanciunas beat the buzzer\" is plausible, especially in the context of basketball. In basketball terminology, \"beating the buzzer\" refers to a player making a shot just before the game or quarter buzzer sounds, which counts if it goes in. Jonas Valanciunas, being a professional basketball player, could indeed have a moment in a game where he makes a shot just in time. Therefore, the sentence is plausible.\n\nThe answer is plausible."

        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "Yes, the sentence \"Malcolm Brogdon banked the shot in\" is plausible. In basketball, \"banking a shot\" refers to using the backboard to make a basket, which is a common and accepted technique. Malcolm Brogdon, being a professional basketball player, could realistically make such a shot during a game.\n\nThe answer is yes."

        "question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Joao Moutinho caught the screen pass in the NFC championship\"",
        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "The sentence is not plausible because Joao Moutinho is a professional soccer player, primarily known for his career in football (soccer) and not associated with American football or the NFC Championship, which is a game in the National Football League (NFL). Therefore, it would be unlikely for him to catch a screen pass in that context.\n\nThe answer is no."

        "question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Sam Darnold passed the puck\"",
        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Sam Darnold passed the puck\" is not plausible because Sam Darnold is a professional American football quarterback, and the term \"puck\" is associated with ice hockey. In football, players pass a ball, not a puck. Therefore, the context of the sentence is incorrect.\n\nThe answer is no."

        "question": "Is the following sentence plausible? \"Carson Wentz set the pick and roll\"",
        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Carson Wentz set the pick and roll\" is not plausible in the context of his professional career. Carson Wentz is a quarterback in the NFL, and the term \"pick and roll\" is primarily associated with basketball, where a player sets a screen (the pick) for a teammate handling the ball and then moves towards the basket (the roll) to receive a pass. Therefore, it would be unusual and incorrect to use this basketball terminology in relation to Wentz's role in football.\n\nThe answer is no."

        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Liam Hendricks hit a double in the World Series\" is not plausible because Liam Hendricks is a professional baseball pitcher, and pitchers typically do not hit in the American League due to the designated hitter rule. While there are instances where pitchers may bat in the National League or in interleague play, it is highly unlikely for a pitcher to have a significant hitting performance in the World Series, especially hitting a double. \n\nThe answer is no."

        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Draymond Green threw a touchdown\" is not plausible in the context of his professional career. Draymond Green is a professional basketball player known for his role in the NBA, primarily with the Golden State Warriors. Touchdowns are a term associated with American football, where they are scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone. Since Draymond Green does not play football, the action of him throwing a touchdown does not fit his known athletic background.\n\nThe answer is no."

        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Sonny Gray was out at second\" is plausible if it refers to a baseball game situation where Sonny Gray, a professional baseball player, was attempting to reach second base and was tagged out by the opposing team. In baseball, players can be called out at various bases, including second base, during a play. Therefore, the context of the sentence makes it plausible.\n\nThe answer is plausible."

        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",

        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Wayne Rooney shot from outside the eighteen\" is plausible. In soccer, the \"eighteen\" typically refers to the penalty area, which is 18 yards from the goal. Wayne Rooney, a professional soccer player known for his powerful shots, could realistically take a shot from outside this area during a game. Therefore, the context of the sentence aligns with typical soccer scenarios.\n\nThe answer is plausible."

        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Samir Nasri did a double stepover in the World Cup\" is plausible in the sense that it describes a specific type of skill move (the double stepover) that a football player like Samir Nasri could perform during a match. However, it is important to note that Samir Nasri did not participate in a World Cup tournament, as he was not selected for the French national team in the World Cup years during his career. Therefore, while the action described is plausible, the context of it happening in a World Cup is not accurate.\n\nThe answer is no."

        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "The sentence \"Jorge Soler entered the attacking zone\" is plausible depending on the context. If it refers to a sport like soccer or hockey, where \"attacking zone\" is a common term, it makes sense. Jorge Soler is a professional baseball player, so if the context is about a different sport, it could be seen as unusual. However, if it's metaphorical or part of a narrative, it could still work.\n\nThe answer is yes."

Juan Soto is a professional baseball player known for his skills in baseball, not basketball.

In baseball, when a batter receives four balls (pitches that are outside the strike zone and not swung at), they are awarded first base, which is referred to as a \"walk.\" Therefore, it is entirely possible for Fernando Tatis Jr. to have walked on ball four.\n\nThe answer is yes."

In this context, \"getting into the endzone\" means that he scored a touchdown by carrying the ball into the end zone area of the opposing team's field. If Mike Williams is indeed a football player, then the sentence makes sense and is likely to be true in a game scenario.\n\nThe answer is plausible."

However, it is unusual because Bale is primarily known for his football career, not basketball. \n\nIn a literal sense, the sentence could be seen as odd, but it is not impossible if we consider a playful or crossover context. \n\nThe answer is yes."
