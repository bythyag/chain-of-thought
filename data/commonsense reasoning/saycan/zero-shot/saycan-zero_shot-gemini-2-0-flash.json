        "answer_text": "Okay, I can help you with that. To \"clear off\" a close counter table typically means to remove any items that are currently on the table, leaving the surface clean and empty. Here's a detailed breakdown of how to do that:\n\n1.  **Assess the Table's Contents:** Before you start, take a quick look at everything on the table. Identify what items are present and roughly categorize them. Are there dirty dishes, mail, tools, decorative items, or a mix of things? This will help you decide where each item needs to go.\n\n2.  **Gather Supplies:** It's helpful to have a few things on hand:\n    *   **Boxes or Baskets:** For items that need to be stored or relocated.\n    *   **Trash Bag:** For any garbage or disposable items.\n    *   **Cleaning Supplies:** A cloth or sponge and a cleaning spray for wiping down the table after it's cleared.\n\n3.  **Remove Items:** Start by systematically removing items from the table, one by one.\n    *   **Trash:** Dispose of any obvious trash (wrappers, used tissues, etc.) directly into the trash bag.\n    *   **Dishes:** Gather any dirty dishes and take them to the sink or dishwasher. Rinse off any food residue to prevent odors or attracting pests.\n    *   **Items to be Relocated:** Place items that belong elsewhere (mail, tools, books, etc.) into the boxes or baskets to be put away later. Group similar items together to make putting them away easier.\n    *   **Items to be Stored:** For items that need to be stored away (decorations, seasonal items, etc.), place them in a designated box or storage container.\n\n4.  **Clean the Table Surface:** Once the table is completely clear, wipe it down with a damp cloth or sponge and a cleaning spray. This will remove any spills, crumbs, or dust.\n\n5.  **Put Away Items:** Now that the table is clear and clean, take the boxes or baskets containing the relocated and stored items and put them in their proper places. Make sure everything is organized and easily accessible.\n\nThe answer is Clear the table by removing all items, disposing of trash, washing dishes, relocating items to their proper places, and cleaning the surface.\n"

        "question": "I‚Äôd like a clear soda.",
        "original_answer": "The answer is 1. find a 7up, 2. pick up the 7up, 3. bring it to you, 4. put down the 7up, 5. done.",
        "answer_text": "Okay! When you say clear soda, there are several options to choose from. To help me narrow it down and make the best recommendation for you, could you tell me what you're in the mood for? Here are a few common types:\n\n*   **Lemon-Lime Soda:** This is probably the most popular category. Think brands like Sprite or 7-Up. They offer a sweet and tangy flavor.\n*   **Ginger Ale:** This offers a light, spicy, and refreshing flavor. Brands like Canada Dry or Schweppes are common. Some ginger ales are bolder than others.\n*   **Club Soda/Sparkling Water (Unflavored):** If you're looking for something with no sugar or added flavorings, this is the way to go. Brands like SodaStream or just plain generic club soda are good choices. It's just carbonated water.\n*   **Other Less Common Clear Sodas:** There are less common options too, such as clear cream soda or various flavored sparkling waters.\n\nSo, do any of those sound particularly appealing? Are you looking for sweet, spicy, or something else?\n\nThe answer is I need more information to answer.\n"
