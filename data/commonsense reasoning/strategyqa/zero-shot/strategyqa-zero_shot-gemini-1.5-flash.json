    "question": "Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?",
    "original": "The answer is yes",
    "answer": "The question of whether more people are related to Genghis Khan or Julius Caesar is a complex one, hinging on the nature of genetic inheritance and the historical circumstances of each individual.  While definitive proof is impossible, genetic studies strongly suggest that far more people today are related to Genghis Khan than to Julius Caesar.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to this:\n\n* **Genghis Khan's extensive lineage:** Genghis Khan, as the founder of the Mongol Empire, had a vast number of descendants through both his sons and other relatives who held positions of power.  His descendants spread across a large geographic area, significantly increasing the chances of his genetic material being passed down through many generations.  Studies have shown a high frequency of a specific Y-chromosome haplogroup (a group of similar Y chromosomes that share a common ancestor) in Central Asia, which is linked to Genghis Khan's lineage. This suggests a significant portion of the male population in that region may share a common ancestor with him.\n\n* **Julius Caesar's lineage:** While Julius Caesar was a powerful and influential figure, his lineage is far less documented and widespread compared to Genghis Khan's. He did not have the same sprawling empire or the same extensive network of descendants that resulted in wide-scale genetic dissemination. His line continued through his daughter Julia, but the extent of its influence is considerably less than that of Genghis Khan.  Furthermore, tracing genetic lineage through the generations is substantially more difficult for those living centuries earlier than Genghis Khan, due to the lack of readily available genealogical records.\n\n\n* **Genetic drift and population bottlenecks:** The Mongol conquests led to population bottlenecks – significant reductions in population size – that increased the relative frequency of Genghis Khan's genetic lineage.  Genetic drift, the random fluctuations in gene frequency, further amplified this effect.  In contrast, Julius Caesar's lineage did not experience these same population-altering events to the same degree.\n\n\nIt's crucial to note that these analyses generally focus on paternal lineage (Y-chromosome) because it's more easily traced. Maternal lineage (mitochondrial DNA) is also relevant but presents different challenges for tracing.  However, even considering these factors, the available evidence strongly supports the conclusion that a considerably larger number of people today are related to Genghis Khan.\n\n\nThe answer is More people are related to Genghis Khan.\n"

    "question": "Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?",
    "original": "The answer is no",
    "answer": "The members of The Police, the band, have no legal authority to make arrests.  Lawful arrests can only be made by law enforcement officers who have been officially sworn in and authorized by the relevant jurisdiction.  While a band might have a name that suggests a connection to law enforcement, this is purely a stylistic choice and has no bearing on their legal capacity to perform arrests.  Attempting to make an arrest without proper authority is a serious offense.\n\nThe answer is No.\n"

    "question": "Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?",
    "original": "The answer is no",
    "answer": "No, a candy bar containing monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors would not be a safe or effective way to cheer up a depressed friend.  MAO inhibitors are a class of antidepressants that work by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in the brain.  However, these medications must be prescribed and carefully monitored by a doctor because they can have serious side effects and interact dangerously with other medications and foods.  \n\nConsuming an MAO inhibitor in a candy bar form would be uncontrolled and potentially very dangerous.  The dosage would be unpredictable, leading to potentially life-threatening side effects, including:\n\n* **Hypertensive crisis:** A dangerously high blood pressure.\n* **Serotonin syndrome:** A potentially fatal condition characterized by high fever, agitation, muscle rigidity, and confusion.\n* **Interactions with other medications:**  MAOIs interact negatively with many commonly used medications, including some over-the-counter drugs.\n\nFurthermore, even if the dosage were somehow controlled, a candy bar isn't a substitute for proper medical treatment of depression.  Depression is a complex condition requiring professional help, often including therapy and medication prescribed by a psychiatrist or other qualified healthcare professional.  Giving a friend a candy bar containing MAOIs would be irresponsible and potentially harmful.  The best way to help a depressed friend is to encourage them to seek professional help from a doctor or therapist.\n\nThe answer is No.\n"

    "question": "Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?",
    "original": "The answer is yes",
    "answer": "Whether a dog would respond to a bell before a grey seal depends entirely on the dog's training and experience.  Dogs are highly trainable and can be conditioned to respond to various stimuli, including bells.  A well-trained dog might associate a bell with a reward (food, praise, play) and respond readily to it.  A grey seal, on the other hand, is a completely novel stimulus to most dogs.  The dog's response to the seal would depend on its temperament and how it interprets the seal's presence (curiosity, fear, aggression).\n\nIn a scenario where both the bell and the grey seal are presented simultaneously, or shortly after one another, a well-trained dog would likely respond to the bell first *if* it's strongly associated with a conditioned response. The dog's learned behavior of responding to the bell would likely override its initial reaction to the unusual sight of a grey seal.  However, a dog that isn't trained to respond to a bell, or a dog with a strong prey drive, might prioritize investigating the seal over the bell.  The novelty and potential for interaction with the grey seal could overshadow the learned behavior associated with the bell.\n\nTherefore, there is no definitive yes or no answer.  It entirely depends on the individual dog's training, personality, and the specific circumstances of the situation.\n\nThe answer is It depends on the dog's training and temperament.\n"

    "question": "Is a pound sterling valuable?",
    "original": "The answer is no",
    "answer": "The value of a pound sterling, like any currency, is relative and depends on what you're comparing it to.  It's not inherently \"valuable\" or \"not valuable\" in an absolute sense.  Its value fluctuates based on several factors, including:\n\n* **Global economic conditions:**  International events, economic growth in the UK and other countries, inflation rates, and interest rate changes all impact the pound's exchange rate against other currencies. A strong economy generally leads to a stronger currency.\n\n* **Political stability:** Political uncertainty or instability within the UK can negatively affect the pound's value.\n\n* **Supply and demand:** The more demand there is for pounds (e.g., due to increased foreign investment in the UK), the higher its value will be relative to other currencies.\n\n* **Comparison currency:**  A pound might be considered \"valuable\" compared to the currency of a less developed nation, but \"less valuable\" compared to the US dollar or the Euro at a particular point in time.  The exchange rate constantly changes.\n\n\nTherefore, you can't definitively say whether a pound sterling is \"valuable\" without specifying what you're comparing it to and at what specific point in time.  Its purchasing power within the UK is strong, but its relative strength against other currencies fluctuates.\n\nThe answer is It depends on the context and comparison.\n"

    "question": "Is shrimp scampi definitely free of plastic?",
    "original": "The answer is no",
    "answer": "Shrimp scampi, as a dish, is not inherently free of plastic.  The potential for plastic contamination comes from several sources within the supply chain:\n\n* **Packaging:**  Shrimp is often packaged in plastic trays and film, both at the processing plant and at retail.  Even if you buy fresh shrimp, it may have been transported and stored using plastic containers.  The scampi ingredients themselves might be packaged in plastic (e.g., pre-minced garlic, packaged butter).\n\n* **Fishing Gear:**  Commercial fishing for shrimp often utilizes nets and other gear containing plastic components.  Microplastics from these sources can contaminate the shrimp themselves.\n\n* **Processing:**  Shrimp processing plants may use plastic containers, conveyor belts, and other equipment. Microplastics can contaminate the final product during processing.\n\n* **Cooking Utensils:**  While not directly in the shrimp scampi, the cooking process might involve plastic utensils or containers.\n\nTherefore, achieving truly plastic-free shrimp scampi requires careful sourcing and preparation.  One would need to ensure that all ingredients (shrimp, butter, garlic, wine, etc.) are packaged and sourced without plastic.  Furthermore, the cooking process should not use plastic utensils or containers.  Even then, the risk of microplastic contamination from the shrimp themselves remains.  In short, it is highly unlikely to find completely plastic-free shrimp scampi.\n\n\nThe answer is No\n"

    "question": "Will the Albany in Georgia reach a hundred thousand occupants before the one in New York?",
    "original": "The answer is no",
    "answer": "The populations of Albany, Georgia, and Albany, New York, are quite different.  Albany, New York, is a much larger and older city, already well above 100,000 residents.  Albany, Georgia, is significantly smaller. While Albany, Georgia's population could potentially grow, it's highly unlikely it would surpass Albany, New York's population and reach 100,000 residents before Albany, New York's population changes significantly (which is also unlikely given its current size).  Therefore, it's extremely improbable that Albany, Georgia will reach 100,000 occupants before Albany, New York.\n\nThe answer is No.\n"

    "question": "Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?",
    "original": "The answer is yes",
    "answer": "To determine if the box office receipts of the 2017 Wonder Woman film covered the cost of a Boeing 737, we need to consider several factors:\n\n1. **Box Office Gross:**  The worldwide gross of Wonder Woman (2017) was approximately $822 million.  This is the total amount of money earned from ticket sales globally.\n\n2. **Net Profit:** The gross revenue doesn't represent the actual profit.  A significant portion goes to theater owners (typically around 50%), leaving the studio with a smaller amount.  Further deductions include marketing and distribution costs, which can be substantial for a major motion picture.  Therefore, the studio's net profit was significantly less than $822 million.\n\n3. **Cost of a Boeing 737:** The price of a new Boeing 737 varies greatly depending on the specific model and customization.  Prices range from roughly $80 million to over $100 million.  Used aircraft would be significantly cheaper.\n\n4. **Relevance:** The connection between a movie's profitability and the cost of an airplane is tenuous.  A film's revenue doesn't directly translate into purchasing assets like aircraft.  Studios use profits for various purposes, including future film production, overhead, and shareholder dividends.\n\nConsidering these points, even if Wonder Woman (2017) was extremely profitable, it's highly improbable that its net profit after all deductions would be sufficient to purchase a brand-new Boeing 737.  While the film was a massive success, the cost of a 737 is a significant capital expenditure rarely directly linked to a single movie's revenue.\n\nThe answer is No.\n"

    "question": "Is the language used in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines rooted in English?",
    "original": "The answer is yes",
    "answer": "Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' official language is English.  However, the English spoken there is not the same as that spoken in Britain or the United States.  It's a creole, meaning it's a language that developed from a mixture of English with other languages, primarily West African languages brought by enslaved people.  This resulted in a distinct dialect with its own grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.  While rooted in English, it's significantly different and considered a separate language by many linguists.  This creole is commonly known as Vincentian Creole, though it might also be referred to as Saint Vincentian English or other variations. Therefore, while the official and dominant language is fundamentally based on English, it's a unique evolution and not simply \"English\" in its standard form.\n\n\nThe answer is Yes\n"

    "question": "Did the Space Race use relay batons?",
    "original": "The answer is no",
    "answer": "The Space Race was a geopolitical competition between the United States and the Soviet Union primarily focused on achieving milestones in space exploration.  While the term \"Space Race\" evokes the image of a relay race, it didn't literally involve the use of physical relay batons.  The \"batons\" were instead represented by significant achievements like launching the first satellite (Sputnik), putting the first human in space (Yuri Gagarin), and landing the first human on the Moon (Neil Armstrong).  Each successful mission acted as a symbolic \"passing of the baton\" in the competition, driving both nations to push the boundaries of space technology and exploration.  So, while the analogy is apt, the answer is no, they did not use literal relay batons.\n\n\nThe answer is no\n"

    "question": "Are Christmas trees dissimilar to deciduous trees?",
    "original": "The answer is yes",
    "answer": "Christmas trees, while diverse in species, are generally evergreen conifers.  Deciduous trees, on the other hand, lose their leaves annually. This fundamental difference in leaf retention makes them quite dissimilar.  While some aspects might overlap (e.g., both can be grown for ornamentation or timber), their defining characteristic—the shedding of leaves—sets them apart.  Beyond this, conifers like Christmas trees typically have needle-like leaves, cones, and a different branching structure compared to the broad leaves and often differently shaped branching patterns found in deciduous trees.  Their physiological processes and adaptations to different climates also differ significantly.\n\nThe answer is Yes\n"

    "question": "Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?",
    "original": "The answer is no",
    "answer": "The system of electing rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary was complex and evolved over time, and it didn't simply involve landowners electing their rulers in a straightforward manner. While the landed aristocracy, particularly the magnates (powerful nobles), held significant influence in the election process, it wasn't a pure system of direct election by all landowners.\n\nThe Hungarian kings were initially elected by a group of powerful nobles, not all landowners.  This group, which could vary in composition over time, often included high-ranking clergy, as well as the most powerful secular magnates.  The principle of election was established early on, although the exact procedures and the extent of participation varied depending on the circumstances and the strength of different factions within the aristocracy.  The power of the monarch was also often challenged by the nobility.\n\nWhile landowners certainly had a degree of indirect influence through their connections and allegiances to powerful magnates, they did not directly participate in the election process in a structured, universal sense. The actual voting was done by a smaller, select group of powerful nobles who often represented, or at least claimed to represent, the interests of the wider aristocracy and the kingdom. The king's power was dependent on maintaining the balance of power among these groups.\n\nTherefore, while landowners had some influence on who became king, they didn't directly elect their rulers. The election was controlled by a powerful subset of the landed gentry and the Church.\n\nThe answer is No.\n"

    "answer": "To determine if the number of Dragon Ball projects (shows and movies) is less than the number of Friday the 13th projects, we need to count the number of projects for each franchise.\n\n**Dragon Ball:**  The Dragon Ball franchise includes a large number of anime series, movies, OVAs, and video games.  Precise numbers vary depending on what is considered a distinct \"project\" (e.g.,  counting each Dragon Ball Z movie separately or grouping them together). A comprehensive count is difficult to achieve due to regional variations and differing definitions of \"project.\" However, a conservative estimate would put the total number of anime series and movies alone well into the dozens.\n\n**Friday the 13th:** The Friday the 13th franchise consists of 12 main films, plus several sequels, remakes, and various other media like video games and novels. A precise count is challenging, given the various iterations and spin-offs.  However, the main films alone number 12. Accounting for all related media significantly increases this number, yet not to the extent of the Dragon Ball franchise.\n\n\nConsidering the sheer volume of Dragon Ball anime series (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT, Dragon Ball Super), along with the numerous movies and OVAs produced across different timelines, it's highly improbable that the total number of Dragon Ball projects is less than the number of Friday the 13th projects.

    "original": "The answer is yes",
    "answer": "To determine if a student graduating in 2017 would have amnesia about 9/11, we need to consider their age.  Students graduating high school in 2017 would have been born around 1999 or 2000.  Individuals born in 1999 or 2000 would have been between 7 and 8 years old at the time of the 9/11 attacks (September 11, 2001).  While children of that age may not have a fully developed understanding of the event's complexities and global significance, it's highly unlikely they would experience amnesia.  Memories from that age are often fragmented, and the details might be hazy, but the event itself would be generally remembered as a significant occurrence due to its extensive media coverage and impact on society.  Amnesia is a neurological condition, not simply a lack of detailed memory.  It's improbable that a 7 or 8-year-old would experience amnesia from 9/11 unless they suffered a severe head injury or other neurological trauma around that time.\n\nThe answer is No.\n"

    "answer": "There's no definitive answer to whether greed is the most prevalent of the seven deadly sins (pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath, and sloth).  The prevalence of each sin is subjective and depends heavily on cultural context, individual interpretation, and the specific time period being considered.  There's no empirical data to quantify the frequency of each sin.\n\nArguments could be made for several sins being the most prevalent.  For example:\n\n* **Greed:**  In a capitalist society, the pursuit of wealth and possessions is often seen as a driving force behind many actions, potentially making greed appear highly prevalent.  However, this is a perspective shaped by the societal structure.\n\n* **Pride:**  Pride, in its various forms (arrogance, vanity, etc.), is often seen as a root cause of many conflicts and negative behaviors.  It can be argued that pride fuels many other sins.\n\n* **Envy:**  In societies that emphasize comparison and competition, envy can be a powerful motivator leading to harmful actions.\n\n* **Wrath:**  Violence and aggression, fueled by anger and wrath, are tragically common in many parts of the world.\n\nUltimately, the \"most prevalent\" sin is a matter of perspective and interpretation.  There's no objective measure to determine which sin is statistically more frequent than the others. The seven deadly sins are interconnected and often overlap; one sin can easily fuel another.\n\nThe answer is There is no definitive answer.\n"

    "original": "The answer is no",
    "answer": "A psychic who admits to hot reading is, by definition, not trustworthy in the sense that they are not genuinely using psychic abilities.  Hot reading is a technique where a psychic gathers information about a client subtly before a reading, using observation, body language, and clever questioning. They then weave this information into their predictions, creating an illusion of genuine psychic ability.  While they may be skilled at deception and persuasion, their \"predictions\" are based on observation and manipulation, not genuine psychic power.  Therefore, a psychic openly admitting to hot reading is acknowledging they're using deception, which directly contradicts the premise of trustworthy psychic abilities.  Trustworthiness implies honesty and genuine ability, both of which are absent in this scenario.\n\n\nThe answer is No\n"
