        "question": "Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?",
        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "Yes, it is widely believed that more people today are genetically related to Genghis Khan than to Julius Caesar. This is primarily due to the extensive reach and reproductive success of Genghis Khan and his descendants, who are estimated to have millions of descendants today, especially in regions of Asia. Studies have suggested that approximately 0.5% of the male population in regions historically influenced by Genghis Khan may carry his Y-chromosome lineage, which translates to around 16 million men. In contrast, Julius Caesar's descendants are fewer in number, and the likelihood of direct genetic lineage from him is much lower due to the passage of time, fewer documented descendants, and less widespread reproductive success. Therefore, the number of people today related to Genghis Khan exceeds those related to Julius Caesar.\n\nThe answer is yes."

        "question": "Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?",
        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "A Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) candy bar is not a real product; it appears to be a humorous or fictional concept. MAO refers to enzymes that break down neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, which are associated with mood regulation. In theory, substances that inhibit MAO (MAO inhibitors) can increase levels of these neurotransmitters and potentially improve mood, and some medications for depression are MAO inhibitors. However, consuming a candy bar labeled as \"Monoamine Oxidase\" would not have any therapeutic effect and could be dangerous if it contained actual MAO-inhibiting substances, especially without medical supervision.\n\nIn general, offering a candy bar might provide some temporary comfort or a small mood boost due to sugar and the act of sharing, but it is unlikely to significantly cheer up a depressed friend on its own. Effective support involves understanding, listening, and encouraging professional help if needed.\n\nThe answer is no, a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar would not cheer up a depressed friend."

        "question": "Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?",
        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "Yes, a dog would typically respond to a bell before a grey seal. Dogs are domesticated animals that have been trained to respond to bells or similar signals for various purposes, such as meal times or commands. They are highly responsive to auditory cues due to their close relationship with humans and their training history. Grey seals, on the other hand, are wild marine mammals that do not have the same level of responsiveness to human-made sounds like bells. While seals can be trained to respond to certain signals in controlled environments, in general, a dog is more likely to respond to a bell first because of its domestication and training.\n\nThe answer is yes."

        "question": "Is shrimp scampi definitely free of plastic?",
        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "Shrimp scampi, like many seafood dishes, can potentially contain plastic contamination, especially if the shrimp or other ingredients have been exposed to plastic debris or microplastics during harvesting, processing, or packaging. While reputable restaurants and suppliers typically follow safety standards to minimize such risks, it is not possible to guarantee that shrimp scampi is completely free of plastic. Microplastics are pervasive in the environment and can be ingested by marine life, which then enters the human food chain. Therefore, unless the seafood is specifically tested and certified as free of plastics, there is no absolute certainty that shrimp scampi is entirely free of plastic contamination.\n\nThe answer is no."

        "question": "Will the Albany in Georgia reach a hundred thousand occupants before the one in New York?",
        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "To determine whether Albany in Georgia will reach a population of 100,000 before Albany in New York, we need to consider their current populations and growth trends.\n\nAs of recent data:\n- Albany, Georgia, has a population of approximately 77,000.\n- Albany, New York, has a population of around 97,000.\n\nGiven these figures, Albany, New York, is closer to reaching 100,000 than Albany, Georgia. Unless Albany, Georgia, experiences a significantly higher growth rate than Albany, New York, it is unlikely that the Georgia city will reach 100,000 before the New York city.\n\nTherefore, based on current populations and typical growth trends, Albany in New York is more likely to reach 100,000 before Albany in Georgia.\n\nThe answer is no."

        "question": "Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?",
        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "No, the box office receipts of the film \"Wonder Woman\" (2017) do not cover the cost of a Boeing 737. The production budget for \"Wonder Woman\" was approximately $149 million, and while the film was commercially successful, its gross revenue was around $821 million worldwide. However, this revenue is primarily from ticket sales and related distribution rights, not from covering the costs of manufacturing or purchasing a Boeing 737 aircraft. The cost of a Boeing 737 can range from around $89 million to over $120 million, depending on the model and configuration. Therefore, the film's box office receipts are not sufficient to cover the cost of a Boeing 737.\n\nThe answer is no."

        "answer_text": "Biochemistry primarily focuses on the chemical processes and substances within and related to living organisms, such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and carbohydrates. It deals with biological molecules and their interactions, functions, and structures at the molecular level. Gluons, on the other hand, are elementary particles that act as force carriers for the strong nuclear force in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a branch of particle physics. They are fundamental particles involved in the interactions between quarks within atomic nuclei and are not part of biological molecules or processes. Therefore, biochemistry does not study gluons, as they are outside the scope of biological chemistry and are studied within the field of particle physics.\n\nThe answer is no."

        "question": "Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?",
        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "In the Kingdom of Hungary, landowners did not directly elect their rulers in the modern sense of democratic elections. Instead, the monarchy was typically hereditary, with kings often chosen through a combination of hereditary succession and election by a group of powerful nobles or representatives of the nobility, especially during the period of the elective monarchy (from 1301 to 1918). \n\nThe most notable example of this is the election of kings by the noble estates or the \"Diet\" (a legislative assembly), which included high-ranking landowners and nobles. These elections were not universal suffrage but were limited to the aristocracy and high-ranking officials. The landowners, as part of the noble estate, had significant influence in these elections, often acting collectively to choose a ruler who would support their interests. \n\nTherefore, while landowners did not directly vote in a democratic manner, they played a crucial role in the election process of the monarchs, especially during the period when the Hungarian crown was elective. \n\nThe answer is no, landowners did not directly elect their rulers, but they had a significant influence in the election process of the kings in the Kingdom of Hungary."

It manifests as an insatiable desire for wealth, possessions, or power, which can lead to corruption, exploitation, and moral decline. Historically and culturally, greed has been frequently highlighted as a primary source of social and personal issues, often seen as a root cause of other sins such as envy, gluttony, and pride. While the prevalence of each sin can vary depending on context and perspective, greed's pervasive influence and its role in motivating many other sins make it arguably the most prevalent among the Seven Deadly Sins.\n\nThe answer is greed."

        "original_answer": "The answer is no",
        "answer_text": "A psychic who admits to hot reading—an unethical practice where information is obtained secretly or beforehand—raises questions about their honesty and integrity. While they may be transparent about their methods, their admission suggests they rely on techniques that are not genuinely psychic or intuitive, which can undermine their credibility. Trustworthiness depends on the context and the standards one expects; if someone values honesty and ethical practices, admitting to hot reading might be seen as a form of honesty, but it also indicates that their claims of psychic ability are not genuine. Therefore, such an admission generally diminishes their trustworthiness as a true psychic or spiritual advisor.\n\nThe answer is not entirely trustworthy."
