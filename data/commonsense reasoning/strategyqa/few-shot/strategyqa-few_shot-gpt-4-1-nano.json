        "question": "Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?",
        "original_answer": "The answer is yes",
        "answer_text": "Genghis Khan lived from approximately 1162 to 1227, and Julius Caesar from 100 BC to 44 BC. Due to the extensive descendants of Genghis Khan, especially through his many offspring and widespread lineage, a larger proportion of the current population is believed to be related to him. In contrast, Julius Caesar's descendants are fewer and less widespread. Studies suggest that a significant percentage of men today may be related to Genghis Khan, whereas fewer are directly related to Julius Caesar. Therefore, more people today are likely related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar. So the answer is yes."

        "answer_text": "A: Christmas trees are a type of coniferous tree, which are a subset of deciduous trees. Deciduous trees typically shed their leaves annually, while Christmas trees retain their needles year-round. Since Christmas trees are a specific type of coniferous (and thus evergreen) trees, they are not dissimilar to deciduous trees in the broader category, but they are different in their leaf retention. Therefore, Christmas trees are similar to deciduous trees in the broader category but differ in leaf retention. So, the answer is no."

Since 9/11 occurred in 2001, these students would have been about 6 years old at that time. Early childhood memories can vary, but generally, most people do not have clear memories from when they are very young. Therefore, it is unlikely that a student of the class of 2017 would have amnesia about 9/11. So the answer is no."
