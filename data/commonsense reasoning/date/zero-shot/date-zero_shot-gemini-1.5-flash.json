    "answer": "To find the date 10 days ago, we first need to determine the \"now\" date.  The problem states the deadline is June 1st, 2021, and that this is 2 days away from \"now\". Therefore, \"now\" is two days before June 1st, 2021, which is May 30th, 2021.\n\nTo find the date 10 days ago from May 30th, 2021, we subtract 10 days:\n\nMay 30th - 10 days = May 20th, 2021\n\nTherefore, the date 10 days ago was May 20th, 2021.
