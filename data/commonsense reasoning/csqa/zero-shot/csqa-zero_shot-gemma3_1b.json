    "question": "The sanctions against the school were a punishing blow, and they seemed to what the efforts the school had made to change? Answer Choices: (a) ignore (b) enforce (c) authoritarian (d) yell at (e) avoid",
    "original": "The answer is (a)",
    "answer": "The question asks about the effect of sanctions on a school’s efforts to change. Sanctions are designed to punish and discourage, thus impacting the school’s progress. Of the provided answer choices, “enforce” and “authoritarian” are most directly relevant. “Enforce” implies a direct consequence of the sanctions – the school is being punished. “Authoritarian” suggests a forceful and controlling approach, which could be a reaction to the sanctions, but isn’t the primary intended effect. “Yell at” is an irrelevant and negative action. “Avoid” is a passive response and doesn’t address the intended impact of the sanctions. Therefore, the most accurate answer is “enforce”.\n\nThe answer is enforce"

It’s not a significant solution.\n*   **(b) calligrapher's hand:** This is a highly specialized technique where a calligrapher uses their finger to gently draw ink into a small area, effectively ‘absorbing’ it. It's a very precise and delicate method.\n*   **(c) inkwell:** Inkwells are designed to hold ink; they don’t absorb it.\n*   **(d) desk drawer:** A desk drawer is a relatively small storage space, unlikely to contain enough ink to significantly absorb.\n*   **(e) blotter:** A blotter is used for blotting, not for absorbing ink.\n\nTherefore, the most effective method for absorbing extra ink from a fountain pen is to use a calligrapher’s hand.\n\nThe answer is (b)"

However, the fullness is often accompanied by a subtle discomfort – a feeling that your stomach is expanding.  Beyond just fullness, there can be a heightened awareness of the palate, with flavors intensifying and becoming more pronounced. Some people report a slight churning sensation in the stomach, a feeling of being weighed down, or even a slight bloating, though this is not universally experienced.  There's also a potential for a temporary sensation of indigestion or slight discomfort, which isn't always present, but can occur.  Finally, the experience can evoke a feeling of satisfaction, often linked to the complexity and artistry of the food, and the overall enjoyment of the meal.\n\nThe answer is {satisfaction}"
