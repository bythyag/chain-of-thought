Let's call that \"x\".\n\nWe know that Gloria started with \"x\" raspberries, and then Margaret gave him 7 more. So we can write that as:\n\nx + 7\n\nWe also know that after Margaret gave him the raspberries, Gloria had a total of 33 raspberries. So we can set up the equation:\n\nx + 7 = 33\n\nTo solve for x, we need to subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx + 7 - 7 = 33 - 7\n\nx = 26\n\nSo Gloria had $\\boxed{26}$ raspberries in the first place.\n"
