Find the total number of cards Nell had initially:**\n\n* Total cards = Baseball cards + Ace cards\n* Total cards = 309 + 356 = 665 cards\n\n**2. Find the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff:**\n\n* Cards given away = Total cards initially - Total cards left\n* Cards given away = 665 - 415 = 250 cards\n\n**3. Determine how many baseball cards and Ace cards Nell has left. **\n\n*Let \"x\" represent the number of baseball cards Nell has left. Then \"415 - x\" represents the number of Ace cards she has left.*\n\n*We know she gave away 250 cards total, so we can find how many of each type of card she gave away:*\n    *Baseball cards given away:* 309 - x\n    *Ace cards given away:* 356 - (415 - x)\n\n*Because we know the total cards given away, we can set up this equation:*\n    *(309 - x) + (356 - (415 - x)) = 250*\n    *309 - x + 356 - 415 + x = 250*\n    *250 = 250*\n\n*Because the x's cancel out, we can't use this equation to determine the number of baseball cards left. Instead, we can determine two possibilities:*\n    *Possibility 1: Nell only has baseball cards left. In this case, she has 415 baseball cards and 0 Ace cards.*\n    *Possibility 2: Nell only has Ace cards left. In this case, she has 0 baseball cards and 415 Ace cards.*\n\n*Since the problem specifies that Nell has both baseball and Ace cards left, we can assume that the problem has an error and instead find how many more baseball cards than Ace cards Nell had initially.*\n\n**4. Find the initial difference between baseball and Ace cards:**\n\n* Difference = Baseball cards - Ace cards\n* Difference = 309 - 356 = -47\n\n**Answer:** Nell initially had 47 fewer baseball cards than Ace cards. It is not possible to determine how many more baseball cards than Ace cards she currently has with the given information."
