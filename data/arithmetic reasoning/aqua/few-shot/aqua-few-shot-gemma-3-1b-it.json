We have 1/7:1/7:1/14. This simplifies to 1:1:1/14. Therefore, A = x, B = x, C = x/14. We want to find how much A is more than C. A - C = x - x/14 = (14x - x) / 14 = 13x / 14.\n\nThe ratio is 1/7:1/7:1/14. The common ratio is 1/14. So we can say A = x, B = x, C = x/14. We want to find A - C.\nA - C = x - x/14 = (14x - x) / 14 = 13x / 14.\n\nThe closest answer choice is 13x / 14, which is approximately 65/7 = 9.2857.
