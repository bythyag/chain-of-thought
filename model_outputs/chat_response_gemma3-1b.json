        "question": "In a truck, there are 26 pink hard hats, 15 green hard hats, and 24 yellow hard hats.  If Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, and John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed, then calculate the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck.",
        "original_answer": "If there were 26 pink hard hats and Carl took away 4 pink hard hats, the number of pink hard hats that remained is 26-4 = <<26-4=22>>22\nJohn also took away 6 pink hard hats, leaving 22-6 = <<22-6=16>>16 pink hard hats in the truck.\nIf John also took twice as many green hard hats as pink hard hats, he took 2*6 = <<6*2=12>>12 green hard hats.\nThe total number of green hard hats that remained in the truck is 15-12 = <<15-12=3>>3\nIn the truck, after some are taken, there were 3 green hard hats + 16 pink hard hats = <<3+16=19>>19 hard hats in the truck.\nAltogether, 19 green and pink hard hats + 24 yellow hards hats = <<19+24=43>>43 hard hats remained in the truck\n#### 43",
        "generated_answer": "Let\u2019s break this problem down step-by-step:\n\n1. **Start with the total:** There are 26 pink + 15 green + 24 yellow = 65 hard hats.\n2. **Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats:** Carl takes away 4 pink hats, leaving 26 - 4 = 22 pink hats.\n3. **John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hats as the number of pink hats that he removed:** John takes away 6 pink hats, and since he removed 4 pink hats, he removes 6 / 4 = 1.5 green hats. Since you can't remove half a hat, we must assume this is a typo and John removes 2 green hats.  So John takes away 6 - 2 = 4 pink hats and 2 green hats.\n4. **Calculate the remaining pink and green hard hats:**  We now have 22 pink hats and 15 green hats.\n5. **Calculate the total number of hard hats remaining:** 22 + 15 = 37 hard hats.\n\nTherefore, the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck is 37.\n\nFinal Answer: 37"

        "question": "It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?",
        "original_answer": "Roque takes 2*3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours a week to walk to work.\nRoque takes 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours a week to walk to and from work.\nRoque takes 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours a week to bike to work.\nRoque takes 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours a week to bike to and from work.\nIn total, Roque takes 12+4 = <<12+4=16>>16 hour a week to go to and from work.\n#### 16",
        "generated_answer": "Roque walks to and from work three times a week, and rides his bike twice a week. So he walks for 3 * 2 = 6 hours per week and rides his bike for 2 * 3 = 6 hours per week. The total number of hours is 6 + 6 = 12 hours. The answer is 12."

        "original_answer": "He bikes 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 miles each day for work\nSo he bikes 40*5=<<40*5=200>>200 miles for work\nThat means he bikes a total of 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 miles for work\nSo he bikes a total of 400/25=<<400/25=16>>16 hours\n#### 16",

If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?\n\nA: Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for 5 days. The distance for each day is 20 miles. So the total distance for 5 workdays is 5 * 20 = 100 miles. He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles. The total distance he covers in a week is 100 + 200 = 300 miles. The time he spends biking is the total distance divided by his speed, which is 300 miles / 25 mph = 12 hours. The answer is 12."
