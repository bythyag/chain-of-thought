        "generated_thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Weng earns $12 per hour for babysitting. She worked 50 minutes yesterday. I need to find out how much she earned.\n\nFirst, I know that 50 minutes is less than an hour. Since her pay is per hour, I need to convert the minutes into a fraction of an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 50 minutes is 50/60 of an hour. Simplifying that, 50 divided by 60 is the same as 5/6. \n\nSo, 5/6 of an hour multiplied by $12 per hour. Let me calculate that. 5/6 times 12. Well, 12 divided by 6 is 2, and 2 times 5 is 10. So that would be $10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 50 minutes is 50/60 hours, which is 5/6. 12 times 5 is 60, divided by 6 is 10. Yep, same answer. So she earned $10. \n\nWait, let me check again. If she worked 50 minutes, and she gets $12 per hour, then per minute she gets 12/60 = $0.20 per minute. So 50 minutes would be 50 * 0.20 = $10. That's another way to get the same result. \n\nEither way, the answer is $10. So I think that's correct.\n</think>"

        "generated_thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is about James writing a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. I need to figure out how many pages he writes in a year.\n\nFirst, I should break it down step by step. Let's start with the weekly amount. He writes to 2 friends twice a week. So each time he writes to a friend, it's 3 pages. Wait, but does he write one letter per friend each time, or is it per friend per week? The wording says \"a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So, maybe each week, he writes two letters (to each of the two friends) twice. Wait, no, maybe it's that he writes to each friend twice a week. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse it again.\n\n\"James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So, each week, he writes two letters (to each of the two friends) twice? Or is it that he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend? Hmm. Wait, the phrasing is \"to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So maybe each week, he writes two letters, each to a different friend, and each letter is 3 pages. So that would be 2 letters per week, each 3 pages. So 2 * 3 = 6 pages per week. But wait, the wording says \"twice a week\" as in the frequency. So maybe he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend. So each week, he writes two letters, each 3 pages. So 2 * 3 = 6 pages per week.\n\nBut then, if he does that every week, how many weeks in a year? 52 weeks. So 6 pages per week times 52 weeks would be 6 * 52. Let me calculate that. 6*50 is 300, and 6*2 is 12, so total 312. So the answer would be 312 pages per year.\n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So maybe it's that he writes two letters each week, each to a different friend. So each week, two letters, each 3 pages. So 2*3=6 pages per week. Then 6*52=312. That seems right. But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"twice a week\" refers to the number of times he writes to each friend. So he writes to each of the two friends twice a week. So that's 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages. So 4*3=12 pages per week. Then 12*52=624. But that would be different. So which interpretation is correct?\n\nThe original question is: \"James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So the structure is: he writes a 3-page letter (to 2 different friends) twice a week. So the \"twice a week\" applies to the entire action of writing to the two friends. So perhaps each week, he writes two letters, each to a different friend. So that's two letters per week. So 2*3=6 pages per week. Then 6*52=312. But maybe the \"twice a week\" is per friend. So for each friend, he writes twice a week. So two friends, each writing twice a week. That would be 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages. 4*3=12 pages per week. Then 12*52=624.\n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. But the way the question is phrased, \"to 2 different friends twice a week,\" the \"twice a week\" is probably referring to the frequency of the action of writing to both friends. So maybe each week, he writes two letters (to each of the two friends) once. Wait, but that would be once a week. If he writes twice a week, then maybe he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend. So that's two letters per week. So 2*3=6 pages per week. Then 6*52=312. But I need to check the exact wording again.\n\nThe question says: \"James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" The key is that \"twice a week\" is the frequency of the action. So each week, he does this action twice. The action is writing a 3-page letter to 2 different friends. So each time he does this action, he writes a 3-page letter to each of the two friends. Wait, that would be 2 letters per action. So each time he does the action (twice a week), he writes two letters. So each week, he does the action twice, so 2 actions per week, each action being writing two letters (to the two friends). So that would be 2 actions * 2 letters per action = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages. So 4*3=12 pages per week. Then 12*52=624. But that seems like a lot. But maybe that's the correct way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"twice a week\" is that he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend. So two letters per week, each 3 pages. So 6 pages per week. Then 6*52=312.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me think of it as: if he writes a 3-page letter to each of the two friends twice a week, then that's 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages, so 4*3=12 pages per week. Then 12*52=624. So that's the answer.\n\nBut maybe the original question is that he writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends (so two letters) twice a week. So that's two letters per week, each 3 pages. So 6 pages per week. Then 6*52=312.\n\nI need to figure out which interpretation is correct. The key is the wording: \"writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So the \"twice a week\" is the frequency of the action of writing to the two friends. So each time he does that action, he writes a 3-page letter to each of the two friends. So each action is two letters. If he does that twice a week, that's 2 actions per week, each with two letters. So 4 letters per week. 4*3=12 pages per week. Then 12*52=624.\n\nBut another way to parse it is that he writes two letters per week (to the two friends), each 3 pages. So 2*3=6 pages per week. Then 6*52=312.\n\nThis is a common ambiguity in word problems. To resolve it, maybe the correct way is to think that \"twice a week\" is the number of times he writes to the two friends. So each week, he writes two letters (to the two friends), each 3 pages. So that's 2*3=6 pages per week. So 6*52=312.\n\nAlternatively, if he writes two letters per week to each friend, that would be 2 friends * 2 times per week = 4 letters per week. But that's not what the question says. The question says he writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. So the \"twice a week\" is the frequency of writing to the two friends. So each week, he writes two letters (to the two friends) twice. Wait, that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct interpretation is that he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend. So each week, he writes two letters (to two friends), each 3 pages. So 2*3=6 pages per week. Then 6*52=312. That seems more likely. Because if it were 2 friends, each written twice a week, that would be 2*2=4 letters per week. But the wording is \"to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So the \"twice a week\" is the frequency of the action of writing to the two friends. So each week, he writes to the two friends twice. So that's two letters per week, each to a different friend. So 2*3=6 pages per week. Then 6*52=312.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. However, given that the answer is likely to be 312, but I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that \"twice a week\" is the number of times he writes to each friend. So each friend gets two letters per week. So 2 friends * 2 letters per week = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages. 4*3=12 pages per week. 12*52=624. That's another possible answer.\n\nBut the original question is a bit ambiguous. However, looking at similar problems, usually, when it says \"writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week,\" it's more likely that he writes two letters per week (to each of the two friends) once. But if it's twice a week, then it's two times per week. So if he writes two letters per week (to the two friends), that's 2*3=6 pages per week. So 6*52=312.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he writes to each friend twice a week. So two friends, each getting two letters per week. So 2*2=4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages. So 4*3=12 pages per week. 12*52=624.\n\nBut how to decide? Let's look at the example given in the previous questions. For instance, in the first question, they had a similar structure. For example, \"If there are 3 cars in the parking lot and 2 more cars arrive, how many cars are in the parking lot?\" The answer is 3+2=5. So the problem is straightforward addition.\n\nIn the case of this question, the key is the interpretation of \"twice a week.\" If \"twice a week\" is the number of times he writes to the two friends, then it's two letters per week. But if it's that he writes to each friend twice a week, that's different.\n\nBut the wording is \"writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.\" So the \"twice a week\" is the frequency of the entire action of writing to the two friends. So each week, he does this action twice. Each time he does this action, he writes a 3-page letter to each of the two friends. Wait, that would be two letters per action. So each action is writing two letters (to the two friends). If he does this action twice a week, that's 2 actions per week, each with two letters. So 4 letters per week. 4*3=12 pages per week. 12*52=624.\n\nBut that seems like a lot. However, maybe that's the correct answer. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the \"twice a week\" is that he writes two letters per week, each to a different friend. So 2 letters per week, each 3 pages. 2*3=6 pages per week. 6*52=312.\n\nI think the answer is either 312 or 624, depending on interpretation. But given that the previous examples are straightforward, maybe the intended answer is 312. However, to be precise, the question is a bit ambiguous. But in most math problems, when it says \"twice a week\" in this context, it's more likely that it's two times per week, each time writing to the two friends. So each week, he writes two letters (to the two friends) twice. Wait, that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that he writes to each of the two friends twice a week. So each friend gets two letters per week. So 2 friends * 2 letters per week = 4 letters per week. Each letter is 3 pages. 4*3=12 pages per week. 12*52=624.\n\nBut I think the correct answer is 312. Because the way it's phrased, \"to 2 different friends twice a week,\" the \"twice a week\" is the frequency of the action of writing to the two friends. So each week, he writes two letters (to the two friends) twice. Wait, that would be two letters per week, but twice a week. No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct way is that he writes two letters per week (to the two friends), each 3 pages. So 2*3=6 per week. 6*52=312.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure. However, given that the problem is likely designed for a certain answer, and considering that similar problems in the examples are straightforward, I think the answer is 312.\n</think>"

I need to find the total number of flowers.\n\nFirst, let's break it down step by step. Starting with the yellow flowers: 10. Then purple is 80% more than yellow.

Let me do the math step by step to avoid mistakes.\n\nStarting with the shirt: $30. Then the pants: $30 + $46 = $76. Then the coat: $76 + $38 = $114. Socks: $114 + $11 = $125. Belt: $125 + $18 = $143. \n\nSo the total spent on the known items is $143. The total spent including the shoes is $184. Therefore, the shoes must have cost $184 - $143 = $41.\n\nWait, let me check that again. 143 plus 41 is 184. Yes, that's right. So the shoes cost $41. That makes sense. Let me verify the total again. 30 + 46 is 76, plus 38 is 114, plus 11 is 125, plus 18 is 143. Then 143 + 41 is 184. Original budget was 200, minus 16 left is 184 spent. So yes, the shoes must have been $41. I think that's correct.\n</think>"

        "generated_thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. Tina makes $18 an hour. If she works more than 8 hours, she gets overtime. Overtime is her hourly wage plus half of that. So, first, I need to figure out how much she earns for each hour, including overtime.\n\nSo, her regular pay is $18. Overtime is 18 plus half of 18, which is 9. So overtime rate is 18 + 9 = $27 per hour. Wait, is that right? Let me check. The problem says \"your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.\" So that's 18 + (18/2) = 18 + 9 = 27. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, she works 10 hours each day for 5 days. So, each day, she works 10 hours. But the first 8 hours are regular pay, and the remaining 2 hours are overtime. So per day, she gets 8 hours at $18 and 2 hours at $27.\n\nLet me calculate that. For each day: 8*18 + 2*27. Let's compute that. 8*18 is 144. 2*27 is 54. So total per day is 144 + 54 = 198 dollars.\n\nThen for 5 days, it's 198 * 5. Let me do that multiplication. 198 * 5: 200*5 is 1000, minus 2*5 is 10, so 1000 - 10 = 990. So total earnings would be $990.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the total hours and then split between regular and overtime. She works 10 hours a day for 5 days, so total hours is 10*5 = 50 hours. Out of these, 8 hours per day is regular, so 8*5 = 40 regular hours. The remaining 50 - 40 = 10 hours are overtime.\n\nSo regular pay: 40 hours * 18 = 720. Overtime pay: 10 hours * 27 = 270. Total is 720 + 270 = 990. Yep, same result. So the answer should be $990.\n</think>"

Each new ship has twice as many people as the last one. We need to find out how many people were on the first ship.\n\nSo, the monster rises once every 100 years. Three hundred years would mean three incidents: first at year 100, second at 200, third at 300. Each subsequent ship has twice as many people as the previous one. Let's denote the number of people on the first ship as x. Then the second ship would be 2x, and the third would be 4x. \n\nAdding them up: x + 2x + 4x = 7x. According to the problem, this total is 847. So 7x = 847. Solving for x, we divide 847 by 7. Let me do that calculation. 7 times 120 is 840, so 847 minus 840 is 7. That's 120 + 1 = 121.

So the total money he had before buying the shoes was the cost of the shoes plus the change. That's $95 + $15 = $110.\n\nNow, his total savings come from two sources: the allowance and the money from mowing lawns and shoveling. Let's break it down.\n\nHe gets $5 a month for three months.

Each driveway is $7, so that's 7d.\n\nSo total savings is allowance + lawn money + driveway money. That's 15 + 60 + 7d = 75 + 7d.\n\nBut we know that total savings is $110.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, he buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10. So that's straightforward. The cheddar cheese costs $10 total for 2 pounds. Then, the cream cheese is a pound, and it costs half the price of the cheddar cheese. Wait, the cheddar is $10 for 2 pounds, so per pound, that's $5. So half of that would be $2.50 per pound for the cream cheese. Since he buys one pound, that's $2.50.\n\nThen there's the cold cuts, which cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese.

Then he sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week. We need to find his profit over 20 weeks.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the profit per DVD. The cost to make each DVD is $6. He sells each for 2.5 times that, so 2.5 * 6 = $15 per DVD. Then the profit per DVD is selling price minus cost, which is 15 - 6 = $9 per DVD.\n\nNext, how many DVDs does he sell in a week? He sells 500 a day for 5 days, so 500 * 5 = 2500 DVDs per week. Then over 20 weeks, that's 2500 * 20 = 50,000 DVDs.\n\nNow, the total profit would be the number of DVDs sold times the profit per DVD. So 50,000 * 9 = $450,000. But wait, there's also the initial cost of making the movie, which is $2000. But does that cost get spread out over the DVDs? Or is it a one-time cost?\n\nHmm, the problem says he creates a movie for $2000. That might be a one-time cost. So the total profit would be the total revenue from DVDs minus the total cost of DVDs and the initial movie cost. Wait, but the initial movie cost is $2000. But how does that relate to the DVDs? If he makes the movie once, and then sells DVDs, maybe the $2000 is a one-time cost, not per DVD. So the total cost is the initial $2000 plus the cost of all the DVDs made. The cost of DVDs is 50,000 DVDs * $6 each = $300,000. So total cost is 2000 + 300,000 = $302,000. Then total revenue is 50,000 * $15 = $750,000. Profit is revenue minus cost: 750,000 - 302,000 = $448,000. Wait, but the question says \"how much profit does he make in 20 weeks?\" So maybe the initial $2000 is a one-time cost, and the rest is per DVD. So the answer would be 448,000? Or maybe the initial $2000 is included in the cost of the movie, but the problem states that he creates a movie for $2000. So that's a one-time cost, separate from the DVD production. So the profit calculation would be total revenue from DVDs minus total cost (initial movie + DVD production). Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $2000 is the cost of the movie, and each DVD is made for $6. So the total cost is 2000 (movie) + (number of DVDs * 6). The revenue is number of DVDs * 15. So profit is (15 * 50,000) - (2000 + 6 * 50,000). Let's compute that.\n\nRevenue: 15 * 50,000 = 750,000.\n\nCost: 2000 + 6*50,000 = 2000 + 300,000 = 302,000.\n\nProfit: 750,000 - 302,000 = 448,000. So the answer should be 448,000. But wait, the problem says \"he creates a movie for $2000\". Is that the cost of the movie, which is a one-time expense, or is that the cost per movie? The wording is \"creates a movie for $2000\". So that's a one-time cost for making the movie. Then each DVD is made for $6. So the total cost is 2000 + (number of DVDs * 6). Therefore, the profit is as calculated. So the answer is 448,000. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any steps. Let me check again.\n\nYes, the steps are:\n\n1. Profit per DVD: 15 - 6 = 9.\n\n2. Total DVDs sold in 20 weeks: 500 per day * 5 days/week * 20 weeks = 50,000.\n\n3. Total profit from DVDs: 50,000 * 9 = 450,000.\n\nBut wait, this doesn't include the initial $2000 cost. Wait, no. Because the profit is total revenue minus total cost. So the total revenue is 50,000 * 15 = 750,000. The total cost is 2000 (movie) + 50,000 * 6 (DVDs) = 302,000. So profit is 750,000 - 302,000 = 448,000. So the answer is 448,000. Therefore, the answer is 448,000.\n</think>"

        "answer": "If there were 26 pink hard hats and Carl took away 4 pink hard hats, the number of pink hard hats that remained is 26-4 = <<26-4=22>>22\nJohn also took away 6 pink hard hats, leaving 22-6 = <<22-6=16>>16 pink hard hats in the truck.\nIf John also took twice as many green hard hats as pink hard hats, he took 2*6 = <<6*2=12>>12 green hard hats.\nThe total number of green hard hats that remained in the truck is 15-12 = <<15-12=3>>3\nIn the truck, after some are taken, there were 3 green hard hats + 16 pink hard hats = <<3+16=19>>19 hard hats in the truck.\nAltogether, 19 green and pink hard hats + 24 yellow hards hats = <<19+24=43>>43 hard hats remained in the truck\n#### 43",
        "generated_answer": "A: Initially, there are 26 pink + 15 green + 24 yellow = 65 hard hats. Carl takes away 4 pink, leaving 22 pink. John takes away 6 pink and 12 green (twice 6), leaving 22 - 6 = 16 pink and 15 - 12 = 3 green. Yellow remains 24. Total remaining: 16 + 3 + 24 = 43. The answer is 43.",
        "generated_thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck after Carl and John take some away. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial counts: 26 pink, 15 green, and 24 yellow. So total hard hats at first would be 26 + 15 + 24. Let me add those up. 26 + 15 is 41, plus 24 is 65. So there are 65 hard hats initially.\n\nNow, Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats. So the pink hats go from 26 to 26 - 4 = 22. Then John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green as the number of pink he removed. Wait, John takes away 6 pink, so twice as many green would be 2 * 6 = 12 green. \n\nSo let me check that again. John takes away 6 pink and 12 green. So the pink hats after Carl and John would be 26 - 4 (Carl) - 6 (John) = 16. Then green hats would be 15 - 12 (John) = 3. Yellow hats remain the same, 24.\n\nSo total remaining hard hats would be pink (16) + green (3) + yellow (24) = 16 + 3 is 19, plus 24 is 43. Wait, but let me verify again. \n\nOriginal total was 65. Carl takes 4 pink, so that's a decrease of 4. Then John takes 6 pink and 12 green, which is 6 + 12 = 18. So total taken away is 4 + 18 = 22. So 65 - 22 = 43. That matches. So the answer should be 43.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any steps. The problem says Carl takes 4 pink, then John takes 6 pink and twice as many green as the pink he removed. So John's green is 2*6=12. So yes, that's correct. So total taken away is 4 +6 +12 = 22. So 65 -22 = 43. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>"

        "generated_thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Roque's commute to work. He walks and bikes different times a week, and we need to calculate the total time he spends getting to and from work each week.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information. Roque walks to and from work three times a week. Each walk takes two hours one way, so a round trip would be 2 hours each way, totaling 4 hours per day. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says it takes him two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike. So, walking to work is 2 hours, and walking back home would be another 2 hours. So each day he walks to and from work, that's 2 + 2 = 4 hours. But the problem says he walks to and from work three times a week. Wait, does that mean three days a week he walks to and from work, or three times a week he walks one way? Hmm. The wording is \"walks to and from work three times a week\". So each time he walks to and from, that's a day. So three days a week, he walks both ways. So each of those days, he walks 2 hours each way, so 4 hours per day. So three days would be 3 * 4 = 12 hours.\n\nThen, he rides his bike to and from work twice a week. Each bike ride is one hour each way, so a round trip is 1 + 1 = 2 hours per day. So two days a week, that's 2 * 2 = 4 hours.\n\nSo total time would be 12 hours (walking) + 4 hours (biking) = 16 hours. Wait, but wait. Let me check again. The problem says \"how many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?\" So each time he walks to and from, that's a day. So three days of walking, each day 4 hours, so 12. Then two days of biking, each day 2 hours, so 4. Total 16 hours. That seems right. So the answer should be 16.\n</think>"

        "answer": "He bikes 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 miles each day for work\nSo he bikes 40*5=<<40*5=200>>200 miles for work\nThat means he bikes a total of 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 miles for work\nSo he bikes a total of 400/25=<<400/25=16>>16 hours\n#### 16",

Total weekly distance: 200 + 200 = 400 miles. At 25 mph, time = 400 \u00f7 25 = 16 hours. The answer is 16.",
        "generated_thinking": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total time Tim spends biking in a week. He has two types of rides: commuting to work and a weekend ride.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much time he spends commuting. He works 5 days a week, and each day he goes to work and comes back. The distance to work is 20 miles each way, so that's 20 miles there and 20 miles back. So each day, it's 40 miles. Multiply that by 5 days: 40 miles/day * 5 days = 200 miles total for commuting.\n\nThen there's the weekend ride, which is 200 miles. So total miles for the week would be 200 (commute) + 200 (weekend) = 400 miles.\n\nNow, he bikes at 25 mph. Time is distance divided by speed. So 400 miles divided by 25 mph equals 16 hours. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the weekend ride is 200 miles. Commute is 5 days * 2 trips per day * 20 miles each way. Wait, no, each day he goes to work and comes back, so that's 2 trips per day, each 20 miles. Wait, no, that's 20 miles each way, so total per day is 40 miles. 5 days * 40 miles = 200 miles. Then plus 200 miles on the weekend. Total 400 miles. 400 divided by 25 is 16 hours. Yeah, that's right. So the answer should be 16 hours.\n</think>"
