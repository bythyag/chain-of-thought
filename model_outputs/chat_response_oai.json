        "question": "Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?",
        "original_answer": "He bikes 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 miles each day for work\nSo he bikes 40*5=<<40*5=200>>200 miles for work\nThat means he bikes a total of 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 miles for work\nSo he bikes a total of 400/25=<<400/25=16>>16 hours\n#### 16",
        "generated_answer": "Tim rides his bike to work 5 days a week, and his work is 20 miles away. So for each day, he rides 20 miles to work and 20 miles back, which is 40 miles per day. Over 5 days, he rides 5 x 40 = 200 miles to work.\n\nOn the weekend, he goes for a bike ride of 200 miles. So in total, he bikes 200 miles (to work) + 200 miles (weekend ride) = 400 miles in a week.\n\nIf he bikes at 25 mph, we can find the time spent biking by dividing the total distance by his speed: \n\n400 miles \u00f7 25 mph = 16 hours.\n\nThe answer is 16 hours."
