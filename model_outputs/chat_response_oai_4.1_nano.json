        "question": "It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?",
        "original_answer": "Roque takes 2*3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours a week to walk to work.\nRoque takes 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours a week to walk to and from work.\nRoque takes 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours a week to bike to work.\nRoque takes 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours a week to bike to and from work.\nIn total, Roque takes 12+4 = <<12+4=16>>16 hour a week to go to and from work.\n#### 16",
        "answer_text": "Roque walks to and from work 3 times a week, and each time it takes 2 hours to walk to work and 2 hours to walk back, so each walk is 2 hours. For 3 times, that is 3 x 2 = 6 hours.\n\nHe bikes to and from work 2 times a week, and each time it takes 1 hour to bike to work and 1 hour to bike back, so each bike trip is 1 hour. For 2 times, that is 2 x 2 = 4 hours.\n\nAdding these together, 6 hours (walking) + 4 hours (biking) = 10 hours.\n\nThe answer is 10."

        "question": "Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?",
        "original_answer": "He bikes 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 miles each day for work\nSo he bikes 40*5=<<40*5=200>>200 miles for work\nThat means he bikes a total of 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 miles for work\nSo he bikes a total of 400/25=<<400/25=16>>16 hours\n#### 16",
        "answer_text": "Tim bikes 20 miles each workday for 5 days, so total miles for work are 20 x 5 = 100 miles.  \nHe also bikes 200 miles on the weekend.  \nTotal miles biked in a week = 100 + 200 = 300 miles.  \n\nSince he bikes at 25 mph, the total time spent biking is 300 miles \u00f7 25 mph = 12 hours.  \n\nThe answer is 12 hours."
