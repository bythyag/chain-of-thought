    "question": "Two friends plan to walk along a 43-km trail, starting at opposite ends of the trail at the same time. If Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?\nAnswer Choices: (a) 21 (b) 21.5 (c) 22 (d) 22.5 (e) 23",
    "prompt_used": "Q: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?\nAnswer Choices: (a) 50 (b) 45 (c) 65 (d) 78 (e) 64\nA: If 10 is added to each number, then the mean of the numbers also increases by 10. So the new mean would be 50. The answer is a.\n\nQ: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.\nAnswer Choices: (a) 1/2 (b) 3/2 (c) 5/2 (d) 4/2 (e) 7/2\nA: If a / b = 3/4, then b = 4a / 3. So 8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22. This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22. So a is equal to 3/2.

The answer is e.\n\nQ: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?\nAnswer Choices: (a) 1156 (b) 1392 (c) 1480 (d) 1562 (e) 1788\nA: There are 9 one-digit numbers from 1 to 9. There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. There are 401\nthree-digit numbers from 100 to 500. 9 + 90(2) + 401(3) = 1392.
