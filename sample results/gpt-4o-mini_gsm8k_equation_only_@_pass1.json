She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?",
    "model_output": "First, we calculate the total number of eggs Janet has after eating and baking:\n\nTotal eggs = 16  \nEggs eaten for breakfast = 3  \nEggs used for muffins = 4  \n\nRemaining eggs = Total eggs - Eggs eaten - Eggs used  \nRemaining eggs = 16 - 3 - 4  \n\nNext, we calculate the number of eggs she sells at the farmers' market:\n\nRemaining eggs = 16 - 3 - 4 = 9  \n\nNow, we calculate the total earnings from selling the remaining eggs:\n\nEarnings = Remaining eggs * Price per egg  \nEarnings = 9 * 2  \n\nFinally, we compute the total earnings:\n\nEarnings = 9 * 2 = 18  \n\nThe answer is 18.",
