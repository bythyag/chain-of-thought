    "model_output": "The answer is 18 dollars.\n\nTo find out how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we first need to determine how many eggs she has left after eating and baking.\n\n1. Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.\n2. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast.\n3. She uses 4 eggs to bake muffins.\n\nNow, we calculate the total number of eggs she consumes each day:\n- Total eggs consumed = 3 (for breakfast) + 4 (for muffins) = 7 eggs.\n\nNext, we find out how many eggs are left after she consumes them:\n- Eggs left = Total eggs laid - Total eggs consumed = 16 - 7 = 9 eggs.\n\nJanet sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 each. Therefore, we calculate her daily earnings from selling the eggs:\n- Earnings = Number of eggs sold × Price per egg = 9 × 2 = 18 dollars.\n\nThus, Janet makes 18 dollars every day at the farmers' market.",
