    "prompt_used": "Q: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?\nA: Hamsters are prey animals. Prey are food for predators. Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals. So\nthe answer is yes.\n\nQ: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?\nA: Brooke Shields went to Princeton University. Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania. So the\nanswer is yes.\n\nQ: Yes or no: Hydrogen’s atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?\nA: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. 1 squared is 1. There are 5 Spice Girls. Thus, Hydrogen’s atomic\nnumber squared is less than 5. So the answer is no.\n\nQ: Yes or no: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?\nA: College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June. December is in the winter, so\nthere can be frost. Thus, there could be frost at some commencements.

Thus,\na pear would float. So the answer is no.\n\nQ: Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?\nA:",
    "model_output": "Genghis Khan had numerous descendants due to his large number of wives and offspring, as well as the vast territories he conquered. Studies suggest that around 16 million men today carry a Y chromosome that can be traced back to him. Julius Caesar had fewer descendants since he had only one biological child. Therefore, more people today are likely related to Genghis Khan than to Julius Caesar. So the answer is yes. \n\nThe answer is yes.",

    "prompt_used": "Q: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?\nA: Hamsters are prey animals. Prey are food for predators. Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals. So\nthe answer is yes.\n\nQ: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?\nA: Brooke Shields went to Princeton University. Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania. So the\nanswer is yes.\n\nQ: Yes or no: Hydrogen’s atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?\nA: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. 1 squared is 1. There are 5 Spice Girls. Thus, Hydrogen’s atomic\nnumber squared is less than 5. So the answer is no.\n\nQ: Yes or no: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?\nA: College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June. December is in the winter, so\nthere can be frost. Thus, there could be frost at some commencements.

    "prompt_used": "Q: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?\nA: Hamsters are prey animals. Prey are food for predators. Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals. So\nthe answer is yes.\n\nQ: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?\nA: Brooke Shields went to Princeton University. Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania. So the\nanswer is yes.\n\nQ: Yes or no: Hydrogen’s atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?\nA: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. 1 squared is 1. There are 5 Spice Girls. Thus, Hydrogen’s atomic\nnumber squared is less than 5. So the answer is no.\n\nQ: Yes or no: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?\nA: College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June. December is in the winter, so\nthere can be frost. Thus, there could be frost at some commencements.
