"He waited for his friend at the squash court, but he was worried his friend thought he meant the at the other end of the public what? Answer Choices: (a) country club (b) rich person's house (c) pool (d) park (e) fitness center",Correct,1,correct,d,d,"To answer this question, we need to determine which place could have multiple squash courts at different ends, leading to confusion about the meeting spot. The options are:

(a) country club  
(b) rich person's house  
(c) pool  
(d) park  
(e) fitness center

A ""country club"" typically has squash courts, but these are usually in one area and ""the other end of the public country club"" doesn’t quite fit.  
A ""rich person's house"" is not a public place, so that doesn't fit.  
A ""pool"" is not typically associated with squash courts.  
A ""park"" is a public place, and sometimes has sports facilities at different ends, which could lead to confusion.  
A ""fitness center"" can have multiple courts (squash, racquetball, etc.), and is a public place.

The clue is ""the other end of the public what?""—implying a large public area with differing facilities at either end. Given that, ""park"" best fits as it can have courts at different locations and is a public area.

We're looking for a place where you might be standing in a line, and if it's cold, you'd need a coat.

Let's analyze the answer choices:
(a) graph — This is not a physical place you stand, so it's not correct.

(c) good book — Not a place.
(d) post office — You may stand in line at a post office, but typically this is indoors too, so a coat for the cold is less relevant.

A furniture store primarily sells furniture, not fishing equipment.  
A fishing camp may be a place to fish or learn fishing, but it's not primarily a store.  
A hardware store focuses on tools and building materials; while some may carry outdoor gear, it's not the main source for fishing rods.

An engine is not a place to buy anything.

"The friends loved competing against one another, it was a good way to work their what? Answer Choices: (a) friendship (b) aggression (c) defeat (d) winning or losing (e) sweat",Correct,1,correct,b,b,"To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the question. The friends loved competing; competition is a way to channel or work out certain feelings or qualities. The likely ones here could be aggression, as competition often involves working out aggressive energy in a friendly or controlled environment.

(a) friendship — Competition can test friendship, but it is not a way to ""work their friendship.""
(b) aggression — This makes sense, as people can use competition to express or release aggression in a healthy way.
(c) defeat — Not logical; defeat is an outcome, not something they ""work.""
(d) winning or losing — Again, these are outcomes, not qualities to be worked on.
(e) sweat — While competition can make you sweat physically, the phrase ""work their"" in this context likely refers to something more psychological or emotional.

Thus, the answer is b.

(a) bright - something obtuse could be not bright.
(b) pointed - an obtuse angle is not pointed.

(d) acute angled - an obtuse angle definitely could not be acute angled, as an acute angle is less than 90 degrees, the exact opposite.
(e) clear - obtuse can also mean unclear, so it couldn't be clear.

What prevents someone from getting sleep at night? Answer Choices: (a) relax (b) dreams (c) have nightmares (d) restlessness (e) snore,Correct,1,correct,d,d,"To answer the question, we need to find which option specifically prevents someone from getting sleep at night. 

(a) relax - Relaxing generally helps people sleep, so this does not prevent sleep.
(b) dreams - Dreams typically occur after one has fallen asleep, so they do not prevent getting to sleep.
(c) have nightmares - Having nightmares occurs during sleep, not before, so it does not prevent one from getting to sleep, though it could disturb sleep.
(d) restlessness - Restlessness makes it hard for a person to relax or fall asleep in the first place, preventing someone from getting sleep at night.
(e) snore - Snoring occurs during sleep and affects others' ability to sleep, but not necessarily the person snoring.
