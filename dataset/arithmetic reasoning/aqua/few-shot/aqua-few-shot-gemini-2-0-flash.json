If Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?\n\nAnswer Choices:\nA)21 B)21.5 C)22 D)22.5 E)23",
        "original_answer": "E",
        "answer_text": "Let $r_P$ be the rate of Friend P and $r_Q$ be the rate of Friend Q.\nWe are given that $r_P = r_Q + 0.15 r_Q = 1.15 r_Q$.\nLet $t$ be the time when they pass each other.\nThe distance walked by Friend P is $d_P = r_P t$ and the distance walked by Friend Q is $d_Q = r_Q t$.\nSince they start at opposite ends of the trail, the sum of the distances they walked is 43 km.\nSo, $d_P + d_Q = 43$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $d_P$ and $d_Q$, we have $r_P t + r_Q t = 43$.\nSince $r_P = 1.15 r_Q$, we can write $1.15 r_Q t + r_Q t = 43$.\nFactoring out $r_Q t$, we get $(1.15 + 1) r_Q t = 43$, which simplifies to $2.15 r_Q t = 43$.\nWe want to find $d_P = r_P t = 1.15 r_Q t$.\nFrom $2.15 r_Q t = 43$, we have $r_Q t = \\frac{43}{2.15} = 20$.\nThen $d_P = 1.15 r_Q t = 1.15 (20) = 23$.\nThe distance Friend P has walked when they pass each other is 23 km.\nThe answer is (E).\n"

        "original_answer": "C",
        "answer_text": "A: Since line k passes through the origin, the equation of the line is y = (1/5)x. For the point (x, 1) to be on the line, we must have 1 = (1/5)x, which means x = 5. For the point (5, y) to be on the line, we must have y = (1/5)(5), which means y = 1. Therefore, the values of x and y are 5 and 1, respectively. The answer is (c).\n"

        "original_answer": "A",
        "answer_text": "The quarterly interest rate is 4%, so the quarterly interest payment is 0.04 * $10,000 = $400. Since the interest is compounded quarterly, the annual interest is 4 * $400 = $1600 plus the interest on the interest. The interest on interest is 0.04 * $400 + 0.04 * ($400 + 0.04 * $400) + 0.04 * ($400 + 0.04 * $400 + 0.04 * ($400 + 0.04 * $400)) which is approximately $65. So the approximate interest he pays annually is $1600 + $65 = $1665. The closest answer is (a).\n"

The number of ways to choose 2 members from k-4 members is (k-4)C2 = (k-4)(k-5)/2. We are given that this is equal to 6. So (k-4)(k-5)/2 = 6, which means (k-4)(k-5) = 12.
