        "original_answer": "If there were 26 pink hard hats and Carl took away 4 pink hard hats, the number of pink hard hats that remained is 26-4 = <<26-4=22>>22\nJohn also took away 6 pink hard hats, leaving 22-6 = <<22-6=16>>16 pink hard hats in the truck.\nIf John also took twice as many green hard hats as pink hard hats, he took 2*6 = <<6*2=12>>12 green hard hats.\nThe total number of green hard hats that remained in the truck is 15-12 = <<15-12=3>>3\nIn the truck, after some are taken, there were 3 green hard hats + 16 pink hard hats = <<3+16=19>>19 hard hats in the truck.\nAltogether, 19 green and pink hard hats + 24 yellow hards hats = <<19+24=43>>43 hard hats remained in the truck\n#### 43",
        "answer_text": "Let's first find the number of hard hats of each color that remained in the truck.\nInitially, there are 26 pink hard hats.\nCarl takes away 4 pink hard hats, so the number of pink hard hats remaining is $26 - 4 = 22$.\nJohn takes away 6 pink hard hats, so the number of pink hard hats remaining is $22 - 6 = 16$.\nInitially, there are 15 green hard hats.\nJohn takes away twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed. John removed 6 pink hard hats, so he takes away $2 \\times 6 = 12$ green hard hats.\nThe number of green hard hats remaining is $15 - 12 = 3$.\nInitially, there are 24 yellow hard hats.\nNo yellow hard hats were removed, so the number of yellow hard hats remaining is 24.\nThe total number of hard hats remaining in the truck is the sum of the remaining pink, green, and yellow hard hats.\nTotal number of hard hats remaining = $16 + 3 + 24 = 43$.\n\nThe number of pink hard hats remaining is $26 - 4 - 6 = 16$.\nThe number of green hard hats remaining is $15 - 2 \\times 6 = 15 - 12 = 3$.\nThe number of yellow hard hats remaining is 24.\nThe total number of hard hats remaining is $16 + 3 + 24 = 43$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{43}$"

        "question": "It takes Roque two hours to walk to work and one hour to ride his bike to work. Roque walks to and from work three times a week and rides his bike to and from work twice a week. How many hours in total does he take to get to and from work a week with walking and biking?",
        "original_answer": "Roque takes 2*3 = <<2*3=6>>6 hours a week to walk to work.\nRoque takes 6*2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours a week to walk to and from work.\nRoque takes 1*2 = <<1*2=2>>2 hours a week to bike to work.\nRoque takes 2*2 = <<2*2=4>>4 hours a week to bike to and from work.\nIn total, Roque takes 12+4 = <<12+4=16>>16 hour a week to go to and from work.\n#### 16",
        "answer_text": "Let $w$ be the time it takes Roque to walk to work, and $b$ be the time it takes Roque to ride his bike to work.\nWe are given that $w = 2$ hours and $b = 1$ hour.\nRoque walks to and from work three times a week. So he walks to work 3 times and walks back home 3 times. The total time he spends walking is $3(w) + 3(w) = 6w$.\nSince $w = 2$ hours, the total time he spends walking is $6(2) = 12$ hours.\nRoque rides his bike to and from work twice a week. So he bikes to work 2 times and bikes back home 2 times. The total time he spends biking is $2(b) + 2(b) = 4b$.\nSince $b = 1$ hour, the total time he spends biking is $4(1) = 4$ hours.\nThe total time Roque spends getting to and from work a week is the sum of the time he spends walking and the time he spends biking.\nTotal time = time walking + time biking = $12 + 4 = 16$ hours.\n\nThus, Roque takes 16 hours in total to get to and from work a week with walking and biking.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{16}$"

        "question": "Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?",
        "original_answer": "He bikes 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 miles each day for work\nSo he bikes 40*5=<<40*5=200>>200 miles for work\nThat means he bikes a total of 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 miles for work\nSo he bikes a total of 400/25=<<400/25=16>>16 hours\n#### 16",
        "answer_text": "Here's how to break down the problem:\n\n**1. Daily commute distance:**\n\n* Round trip to work: 20 miles * 2 = 40 miles\n\n**2. Weekly commute distance:**\n\n* Weekly commute: 40 miles/day * 5 days/week = 200 miles\n\n**3. Total weekly biking distance:**\n\n* Total distance: 200 miles (commute) + 200 miles (weekend) = 400 miles\n\n**4. Total biking time:**\n\n* Total time: 400 miles / 25 mph = 16 hours\n\n**Answer:** Tim spends 16 hours biking a week.\n"
