        "original_answer": "Weng earns 12/60 = $<<12/60=0.2>>0.2 per minute.\nWorking 50 minutes, she earned 0.2 x 50 = $<<0.2*50=10>>10.\n#### 10",

        "original_answer": "In one hour, there are 3 sets of 20 minutes.\nSo, Joy can read 8 x 3 = <<8*3=24>>24 pages in an hour.\nIt will take her 120/24 = <<120/24=5>>5 hours to read 120 pages.\n#### 5",
        "answer_text": "To find out how long it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we first need to determine her reading speed in pages per minute.\n\nJoy reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, so her reading speed is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Reading speed} = \\frac{8 \\text{ pages}}{20 \\text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find out how long it will take her to read 120 pages. We can use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Total pages}}{\\text{Reading speed}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values we have:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time} = \\frac{120 \\text{ pages}}{0.4 \\text{ pages per minute}} = 300 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow, we convert the time from minutes to hours:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time in hours} = \\frac{300 \\text{ minutes}}{60 \\text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, it will take Joy **5 hours** to read 120 pages."

        "question": "James creates a media empire.  He creates a movie for $2000.  Each DVD cost $6 to make.  He sells it for 2.5 times that much.  He sells 500 movies a day for 5 days a week.  How much profit does he make in 20 weeks?",
        "original_answer": "He sold each DVD for 6*2.5=$<<6*2.5=15>>15\nSo he makes a profit of 15-6=$<<15-6=9>>9\nSo each day he makes a profit of 9*500=$<<9*500=4500>>4500\nSo he makes 4500*5=$<<4500*5=22500>>22,500\nHe makes 22,500*20=$<<22500*20=450000>>450,000\nThen after the cost of creating the movie he has a profit of 450,000-2000=$<<450000-2000=448000>>448,000\n#### 448000",
        "answer_text": "To calculate James's profit from his media empire, we can break it down into several steps.\n\n1. **Calculate the selling price of each DVD:**\n   - Cost to make each DVD: $6\n   - Selling price = 2.5 times the cost\n   \\[\n   \\text{Selling price} = 2.5 \\times 6 = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the profit per DVD:**\n   - Profit per DVD = Selling price - Cost to make\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit per DVD} = 15 - 6 = 9\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks:**\n   - DVDs sold per day: 500\n   - Days per week: 5\n   - Total days in 20 weeks = 20 weeks × 5 days/week = 100 days\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total DVDs sold} = 500 \\times 100 = 50,000\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the total profit from all DVDs sold:**\n   - Total profit = Profit per DVD × Total DVDs sold\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total profit} = 9 \\times 50,000 = 450,000\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the initial cost of creating the movie:**\n   - Initial cost = $2000\n\n6. **Calculate the total profit after accounting for the initial cost:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net profit} = \\text{Total profit} - \\text{Initial cost}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Net profit} = 450,000 - 2000 = 448,000\n   \\]\n\nThus, James makes a total profit of **$448,000** in 20 weeks."

        "original_answer": "According to the ratio, for every 5 parts that Johnson gets, Mike gets 2 parts\nSince Johnson got $2500, each part is therefore $2500/5 = $<<2500/5=500>>500\nMike will get 2*$500 = $<<2*500=1000>>1000\nAfter buying the shirt he will have $1000-$200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800 left\n#### 800",
        "answer_text": "To find out how much Mike will have after spending on the shirt, we first need to determine Mike's share of the profit.\n\nThe profit is shared in the ratio of 2:5 between Mike and Johnson. This means that for every 2 parts Mike receives, Johnson receives 5 parts.\n\nGiven that Johnson received $2500, we can set up the ratio to find Mike's share.\n\nLet the total parts be \\(2 + 5 = 7\\) parts.\n\nSince Johnson's share corresponds to 5 parts, we can find the value of one part:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Value of one part} = \\frac{2500}{5} = 500\n\\]\n\nNow, we can find Mike's share, which corresponds to 2 parts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mike's share} = 2 \\times 500 = 1000\n\\]\n\nNow, Mike spends $200 on a shirt. To find out how much he has left after this expense, we subtract the cost of the shirt from his share:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mike's remaining amount} = 1000 - 200 = 800\n\\]\n\nThus, Mike will have **$800** after spending on the shirt."
