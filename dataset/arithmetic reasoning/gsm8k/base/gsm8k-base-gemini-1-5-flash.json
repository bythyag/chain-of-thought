        "question": "Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5 workdays.  His work is 20 miles away.  He also goes for a weekend bike ride of 200 miles.    If he can bike at 25 mph how much time does he spend biking a week?",
        "original_answer": "He bikes 20*2=<<20*2=40>>40 miles each day for work\nSo he bikes 40*5=<<40*5=200>>200 miles for work\nThat means he bikes a total of 200+200=<<200+200=400>>400 miles for work\nSo he bikes a total of 400/25=<<400/25=16>>16 hours\n#### 16",
        "answer_text": "Here's how to break down Tim's weekly biking time:\n\n**Weekday Commute:**\n\n* **Distance per day:** 20 miles to work + 20 miles back = 40 miles\n* **Daily commute time:** 40 miles / 25 mph = 1.6 hours\n* **Total weekday commute time:** 1.6 hours/day * 5 days/week = 8 hours\n\n**Weekend Ride:**\n\n* **Weekend ride time:** 200 miles / 25 mph = 8 hours\n\n**Total Weekly Biking Time:**\n\n* **Total time:** 8 hours (weekday commute) + 8 hours (weekend ride) = 16 hours\n\nTim spends a total of $\\boxed{16}$ hours biking each week.\n"
