Let $r$ be the number of balls removed from the basket.\nAfter the balls were removed, there were six balls remaining in the basket.\nThe number of balls remaining in the basket is the original number of balls minus the number of balls removed.\nSo, $x - r = 6$.\nSubstituting $x = 8$, we have $8 - r = 6$.\nTo find the number of balls removed, we solve for $r$:\n$r = 8 - 6 = 2$.\nTherefore, 2 balls were removed from the basket.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$"
