How much did each book cost?\n\nSo:\n\n- Edward **spent $6** to buy 2 books.\n- He now has **$12** left.\n- That means he started with $6 + $12 = **$18**.\n\nNow, he spent $6 on 2 books, and each book cost the same.\n\nSo, the cost of each book is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{6}{2} = 3\n$$\n\n### ✅ Answer: Each book cost **$3**.",

So that’s not possible.\n\nLet’s try to find the **maximum** and **minimum** possible differences.\n\nLet’s try a few values for $ x $ (number of baseball cards given to Jeff):\n\n- If $ x = 0 $:  \n  Baseball left = 309  \n  Ace left = 356 - 250 = 106  \n  Difference = 309 - 106 = **203**\n\n- If $ x = 125 $:  \n  Baseball left = 309 - 125 = 184  \n  Ace left = 356 - 125 = 231  \n  Difference = 184 - 231 = **-47**\n\nSo the difference can vary from **-47 to 203**, depending on how many baseball cards she gave to Jeff.\n\nBut the question is asking:\n\n> **How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?**\n\nThis implies that the answer is **unique**.\n\nBut from the information given, it's **not unique**.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the number of baseball cards left is **as close as possible** to the original number (i.e., she gave away as few as possible), then the difference is **203**.\n\nSo the answer is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{203}\n$$",
